  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Every assembly action must start with an <code>@</code> which is to followed by a memory address or <a href="#labels">label</a> and then followed by code to modify something. For example, <code>@1</code> references the address <code>1</code> and you can access the address with <code>A</code> or the value stored at the memory slot  with <code>M</code> and use <code>D</code> to keep track of values that you want to use later on.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">@100
D = A // A is address which is 100
</code></pre></div>
<p>What this does is stores the address to <code>D</code>, and since we called the address of <code>100</code>, <code>D</code> has a value of <code>100</code>. If we want to assign a spot in memory, <code>i</code>, with a value of <code>2220</code> we can simply do this
<code>
@2220
D = A // first we have to assign D with the value of 2220
@i 
M = D // M is the value held at that memory point.
</code></p>

<p><code>i</code> is some random address in memory but for some things, like the keyboard, you will have to use a numerical value for the address. </p>

<p>Address names don&#39;t have to be capitalized, but to be safe, capitalize <code>M</code>, <code>A</code> and <code>D</code>.</p>

<h2>Labels</h2>

<p>Labels are spots in code that are used to tell where to jump to. <a href="#Jumps">Jumps</a> are mentioned later on but here is an example
<code>
(startLoop) //this is the label
@startLoop
0;JMP // this is a jump that will go to the label startLoop
</code></p>

<p>As you can see labels are formatted like <code>(labelName)</code>. They will be useful later. Note that this is something that you don&#39;t have to put an <code>@</code> before.</p>

<h2>Jumps</h2>

<p>Jumps are used to go to a label as shown before. They can go back or forward in code. There are two types of jumps, unconditional and conditional.</p>

<h3>Unconditional Jumps</h3>

<p>As the name says, these will jump to the label no matter what. 
They are declared with <code>JMP</code>. Here is an example
```
(toJumpTo)
@toJumpTo //we put the label instead of a memory address and this shows where to jump
0;JMP// put a 0 followed by ;JMP to jump</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">
The basic format is:

</code></pre></div>
<p>@labelToJumpTo
0;JMP
```</p>

<p>These are useful to go back to the start of a loop.</p>

<h3>Conditional Jumps</h3>

<p>Conditional jumps will only jump to the label if a condition is met. Instead of <code>JMP</code> you would use different letters for different conditions. The chart below shows the different types of conditions.</p>

<p>| Instruction(code) | Jump Condition           | Jumps when              |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| JEQ          | Jump if Equal            | Equals 0                |
| JNE         | Jump if Not Equal        | Doesn&#39;t Equal Zero      |
| JGT          | Jump if Greater          | Greater than 0          |
| JGE         | Jump if Greater or Equal | Greater or equal to 0   |
| JLT          | Jump if Less             | Less than 0             |
| JLE         | Jump if Less or Equal    | Less than or equal to 0 |</p>

<p>There are more but this is the basics that you should need.</p>

<p>Notice that these all compare to zero. The value we compare with is the value before the semicolon. Let&#39;s say <code>D</code> has a value of <code>12</code>. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">@someLabel
D; JLE
</code></pre></div>
<p>this won&#39;t jump as <code>D</code>, <code>12</code>, is not less than or equal to <code>0</code>. If we want to check if some address <code>i</code> is less than <code>100</code> we can do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">@i
D = M //stores the value of i at D
@100
D = D - A //subtracts 100 from D
@jumpIfLess
D;JLT // Sees if D is less than 0
</code></pre></div>
<p>If <code>i</code> is less than <code>100</code> and we subtract <code>100</code> away, it would be negative. So we want to jump if the <code>D</code> is negative which is the same as less than <code>0</code>. We can just change <code>JLT</code> to <code>JGT</code> if we want to jump if <code>i</code> is greater than <code>100</code>.</p>

<p>If the condition is not met it continues down the code as normal.</p>

<p>You can use any of these jumps and if you want to learn more jumps you can see them <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece390/books/labmanual/assembly.html">here</a> or <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_conditions.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>To build loops, you will have a series of jumps and labels that will keep it looping till a condition is met. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">int sum = 0;
for(int i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++){
    sum += i;
}
return sum;
</code></pre></div>
<p>This adds all of the numbers from 1 to 100</p>

<p>The equivalent of this in assembly is as follows</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">@i
M = 1 //Sets i to 1
@sum
M = 0 //sets our sum to 0

(LOOP) // label for the start of the loop
    @i
    D = M //stores the value of i to D
    @100
    D = D - A // subtracts off 100 from D
    @END // Label of the end of the loop
    D;JGT // if i - 100 is positive we need to end the loop
    @i
    D = M //restores the value of i to D
    @sum
    M = M + D // adds the value of i to D
    @i
    M = M + 1 //increases the value of i by 1
    @LOOP
    0;JMP //jumps back to the start of the loop
(END) // Our label for the end
@END
0;JMP //Infinite loop to end the program
</code></pre></div>
<p>We have to store the value of <code>i</code> to <code>D</code> whenever we want to add to <code>sum</code> because we can&#39;t just do 
<code>
@sum
M = M + i
</code>
because <code>i</code> is an address not a value so you have to store it in <code>D</code>. You have to do this whenever you want to interact with two different addresses.</p>

<p>Note the infinite loop at the end. This means that the program is done.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">(ENDPROGRAM)
@ENDPROGRAM
0;JMP
</code></pre></div>
<p>Just copy this to the last line of your code and the CPU will stop running.</p>

<h2>Cheatsheet</h2>

<p>I found that editing the while loop helped a lot for Mult so here it is without the comments.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">
@i
M = 1
@sum
M = 0

(LOOP)
    @i
    D = M
    @100
    D = D - A
    @END
    D;JGT
    @i
    D = M
    @sum
    M = M + D
    @i
    M = M + 1
    @LOOP
    0;JMP
(END)
@End
0;JMP

</code></pre></div>
