Connexus Safeguard is protection against accidental refreshes or moving to a different page while taking a test, quiz or reading through a lesson. 

Whenever moving to a new page or changing lessons an alert will appear to confirm that you do indeed want to leave the page.

### Features:

- Stops accidental refreshes which may cause you to lose all of your work
- Only will alert of leaving page while in a class
- Works on lesson links as well

### Installing

In order to install you will need to use some extension in order to run the userscript. I recommend [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/). An alertnative is [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) but this is only for firefox. Tampermonkey works with  Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, and Firefox. 

Once you got this extension installed you can download the script here:

To update just click the update scripts button on your extension. 

To remove use your extension to delete or uninstall the script.
